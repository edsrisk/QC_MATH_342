# More Basic R Skills

* Create a function `my_reverse` which takes as required input a vector `v` and returns the vector in reverse where the first entry is the last entry, etc. No function calls are allowed inside your function otherwise that would defeat the purpose of the exercise! (Yes, there is a base R function that does this called `rev`). Use `head` on `v` and `tail` on `my_reverse(v)` to verify it works.

```{r}
#Method I: 
start = 1
end = 15
v = seq(start, end)
my_reverse = function(v) {
    v = v[end : start]
    print("Method I")
    #print(v)
    #print(head(v))
    #print(tail(v))
}
my_reverse(v)

#Method II: 'rev(v)', 'head(rev(v))', 'tail(rev(v))
#Method III 'sort(v, decreasing = TRUE)', head and tail of the sort as well
```

* Create a function `flip_matrix` which takes as required input a matrix, an argument `dim_to_rev` that returns the matrix with the rows in reverse order or the columns in reverse order depending on the `dim_to_rev` argument. Let the default be the dimension of the matrix that is greater. If the number of rows is equal to the number of columns, throw an error.
```{r}
flip_matrix = function(X,dim_to_rev = NA){
  nr = nrow(X)
  nc = ncol(X)
  if(is.na(dim_to_rev)){
    if(nr=nc){
      stop("unspecified dim_to_rev and equal rows and columns")
    }
    if(nr>nc){
      dim_to_rev = " r"
    }else{
      dim_to_rev = "c"
    }
  }
  if(dim_to_rev == "r"){
    X[nr:1,]
    
  }elseif(dim_to_rev== "c"){
    X[,nc:1]
    
  }else{
    stop( " dim_to_rev needs to be r or c.")
  }
}

```
A second option
```{r}
#Method I
n = 3
p = 5
dim_to_rev = c(n, p)
runif_input = round(runif(n * p), digits = 2)
flip_matrix = function(runif_input, dim_to_rev){
  if (n == p) {
    print("Error, row and column cannot be equal")
  } else {
    runif_matrix = matrix(runif_input, nrow = dim_to_rev[1], ncol = dim_to_rev[2])
    print(runif_matrix)
    reversed_matrix = matrix(runif_input, nrow = dim_to_rev[2], ncol = dim_to_rev[1])
    reversed_matrix
  }

}
flip_matrix(runif_input,  dim_to_rev)
```

* Create a list named `my_list` with keys "A", "B", ... where the entries are arrays of size 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 x 3, etc. Fill the array with the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. Make 8 entries according to this sequence.

```{r}
my_list = list()
#my_list$A= array(1,1)
#my_list$B= array(1:4,dim = c(2,2))
#my_list$C= array(1:27,dim = c(3,3,3))

for(i in 1:8){
  my_list[[LETTERS[i]]]= array(1:(i**i),dim = rep(i,i))
}
```

Run the following code:

```{r}
lapply(my_list, object.size)
```
Use `?object.size` to read about what these functions do. Then explain the output you see above. For the later arrays, does it make sense given the dimensions of the arrays?
```{r}
?object.size
#The answer above reflects the space allocated for each of the eight elements of the my_list object in memory
```

Now cleanup the namespace by deleting all stored objects and functions:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## A little about strings

* Use the `strsplit` function and `sample` to put the sentences in the string `lorem` below in random order. You will also need to manipulate the output of `strsplit` which is a list. You may need to learn basic concepts of regular expressions.

```{r}
lorem = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi posuere varius volutpat. Morbi faucibus ligula id massa ultricies viverra. Donec vehicula sagittis nisi non semper. Donec at tempor erat. Integer dapibus mi lectus, eu posuere arcu ultricies in. Cras suscipit id nibh lacinia elementum. Curabitur est augue, congue eget quam in, scelerisque semper magna. Aenean nulla ante, iaculis sed vehicula ac, finibus vel arcu. Mauris at sodales augue. "
strsplit(lorem,split = "\\.\\s")
```
You have a set of names divided by gender (M / F) and generation (Boomer / GenX / Millenial):

* M / Boomer      "Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie"
* M / GenX        "Marc, Jamie, Greg, Darryl, Tim, Dean, Jon, Chris, Troy, Jeff"
* M / Millennial  "Zachary, Dylan, Christian, Wesley, Seth, Austin, Gabriel, Evan, Casey, Luis"
* F / Boomer      "Gloria, Joan, Dorothy, Shirley, Betty, Dianne, Kay, Marjorie, Lorraine, Mildred"
* F / GenX        "Tracy, Dawn, Tina, Tammy, Melinda, Tamara, Tracey, Colleen, Sherri, Heidi"
* F / Millennial  "Samantha, Alexis, Brittany, Lauren, Taylor, Bethany, Latoya, Candice, Brittney, Cheyenne"

Create a list-within-a-list that will intelligently store this data.

```{r}
#HINT: 
#strsplit("Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie", split = ", ")[[1]]
intel_list = list()
intel_list$m = list()
intel_list$f = list()
intel_list$m$Boomer = strsplit("Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie", split = ", ")[[1]]
intel_list$m$Genx = strsplit( "Marc,Jamie, Greg, Darryl,Tim, Dean, Jon, Chris, Troy, Jeff",split = ",")[[1]]
intel_list$m$Millenial = strsplit(" Zachary, Dylan, Christian, Wesley, Seth, Austin, Gabriel, Evan, Casey, Luis",split = ",")[[1]]
intel_list$f$Boomer = strsplit("Gloria, Joan, Dorothy, Shirley, Betty, Dianne, Kay, Marjorie, Lorraine, Mildred",split = ",")[[1]]
intel_list$f$Genx = strsplit("Tracy, Dawn, Tina, Tammy, Melinda, Tamara, Tracey, Colleen, Sherri, Heidi",split = ",")[[1]]
intel_list$f$Millenial = strsplit("Samantha, Alexis, Brittany, Lauren, Taylor, Bethany, Latoya, Candice, Brittney, Cheyenne",split = ",")[[1]]
intel_list

```

## Dataframe creation
Imagine you are running an experiment with many manipulations. You have 14 levels in the variable "treatment" with levels a, b, c, etc. For each of those manipulations you have 3 submanipulations in a variable named "variation" with levels A, B, C. Then you have "gender" with levels M / F. Then you have "generation" with levels Boomer, GenX, Millenial. Then you will have 6 runs per each of these groups. In each set of 6 you will need to select a name without duplication from the appropriate set of names (from the last question). Create a data frame with columns treatment, variation, gender, generation, name and y that will store all the unique unit information in this experiment. Leave y empty because it will be measured as the experiment is executed. Hint, we've been using the `rep` function using the `times` argument. Look at the `each` argument using `?rep`.

```{r}
n = 14 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 10
X = data.frame(
  treatment = rep(letters[1 : 14], each = 6 * 3 * 2 * 3),
  variation = rep(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 6 * 3 * 2), times = 14),
  gender = rep(rep(c("m", "f"), each = 18), times = 3 * 14),
  generation = rep(rep(c("Millenial", "GenX", "Boomer"), each = 6), times = 2 * 3 * 14),
  name = NA,
  y = NA
)
X

```

## Packages

Install the package `pacman` using regular base R.

```{r}
install.packages("pacman")
```


First, install the package `testthat` (a widely accepted testing suite for R) from https://github.com/r-lib/testthat using `pacman`. If you are using Windows, this will be a long install, but you have to go through it for some of the stuff we are doing in class. LINUX (or MAC) is preferred for coding. If you can't get it to work, install this package from CRAN (still using `pacman`), but this is not recommended long term.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(testthat)
```

* Create vector `v` consisting of all numbers from -100 to 100 and test using the second line of code su

```{r}
start = -100
end = 100
v = c(start : end)
expect_equal(v, -100 : 101)
```
If there are any errors, the `expect_equal` function will tell you about them. If there are no errors, then it will be silent.

Test the `my_reverse` function using the following code:

```{r}
expect_equal(my_reverse(v), rev(v))
expect_equal(my_reverse(c("A", "B", "C")), c("C", "B", "A"))
```

## Basic Binary Classification Modeling

* Load the famous `iris` data frame into the namespace. Provide a summary of the columns using the `skim` function in package `skimr` and write a few descriptive sentences about the distributions using the code below in English.

```{r}
rm(list = setdiff(ls(), iris))
data(iris)
summary(iris) #summary stats using generic summary command
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
skim(iris) #summary stats using skimr package
```

TO-DO: describe this data

The outcome / label / response is `Species`. This is what we will be trying to predict. However, we only care about binary classification between "setosa" and "versicolor" for the purposes of this exercise. Thus the first order of business is to drop one class. Let's drop the data for the level "virginica" from the data frame.

```{r}
iris_sub = data.frame(iris)
iris_sub = iris_sub[!(iris_sub$Species == "virginica"),]
#summary(iris_sub)
head(iris_sub)
tail(iris_sub)
```

Now create a vector `y` that is length the number of remaining rows in the data frame whose entries are 0 if "setosa" and 1 if "versicolor".

```{r}
y = c(0)
n = nrow(iris_sub)

for (i in 1 : n){
  if (iris_sub$Species[[i]] == "setosa") {
    y[i] = 0
  } else {
    y[i] = 1
  }
}
y
```

* Write a function `mode` returning the sample mode of a vector of numeric values. Try not to look in the class notes.

```{r}
#TO-DO
x = c(sample(1:100, replace = TRUE))
mode = function(x){
  mode_x = names(table(x))[table(x)==max(table(x))]
  print(x)
  mode_x
}
mode(x)
```

* Fit a threshold model to `y` using the feature `Sepal.Length`. Write your own code to do this. What is the estimated value of the threshold parameter? Save the threshold value as `threshold`. 

```{r}
X_SepalLength = iris_sub$Sepal.Length
Xy = cbind(X, y)
head(X)
head(Xy)
tail(Xy)
summary(Xy)
```

What is the total number of errors this model makes?
total number of errors (ME):  0; this occurs at x_star = 7.0

```{r}
rm(list = setdiff(ls(), "Xy")) #clean up the workspace

#The Threshold Model
n = nrow(Xy)
num_errors_by_parameter = matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = 2) #2-dim matrix to hold our error for every X value
colnames(num_errors_by_parameter) = c("threshold_param", "num_errors")
y_logical = Xy[, 2] == "Yes"
for (i in 1 : n) {
  threshold = Xy[, 1][i]
  num_errors = sum((Xy[, 1] > threshold) != y_logical) #Model for sepal length
  num_errors_by_parameter[i, ] = c(threshold, num_errors)
}
#num_errors_by_parameter
#sort the errors in ascending
num_errors_by_parameter[order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"]), ]
summary_threshold = summary(num_errors_by_parameter[order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"]), ])
summary_threshold
total_errors_ME = as.integer(min(num_errors_by_parameter[order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"]), ]))
cat("total number of errors (ME): ", total_errors_ME)
#create a new subset of the num_threshold_by_parameter for threshold_param = 5.7 and compare results to below
#threshold_compare = data.frame(num_errors_by_parameter)
#threshold_compare = threshold_compare[(threshold_compare$threshold_param == 5.7),]
#summary(threshold_compare)
```

Does the threshold model's performance make sense given the following summaries:

```{r}
threshold
summary(iris[iris$Species == "setosa", "Sepal.Length"])
summary(iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", "Sepal.Length"])
```

TO-DO: Write your answer here in English.
Yes, it does; by comparing the model the the petal lengths I observed the following:
Min: The model has the same minimum (4.3) as setosa
Max: The model has the same maximum (7.0) as versicolor
1st Quantile: While they are not equal, the model's value of 5.0 is much closer to setosa (4.8) than versicolor (5.6)
Median: While they are not equal, the model's value of 5.4 is much closer to setosa (5.0) than versicolor (5.9)
Mean: While they are not equal, the model's value of 5.471 is much closer to the mean of species lengths (5.483)
3rd Quantile: While they are not equal, the model's value of 5.9 is much closer to the 3rd Quantile mean of species lengths (5.75)
Overall, in all cases (not including the min and max values), the value of the threshold model appear to be closed to the mean of the combined species 

Create the function `g` explicitly that can predict `y` from `x` being a new `Sepal.Length`.

```{r}
# We first grab the smallest error in our threshold model, x_star
best_row = order(num_errors_by_parameter[, "num_errors"])[1]
x_star = c(num_errors_by_parameter[best_row, "threshold_param"], use.names = FALSE)
x_star

g = function(x){
  ifelse(x > x_star, 1, 0)
}
g(5)
```
## Perceptron

You will code the "perceptron learning algorithm" for arbitrary number of features p. Take a look at the comments above the function. Respect the spec below:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
#' Perceptron Learning Algorithm 
#'
#' Under the constraints of linear separability between two binary classes, the Perceptron Learning Algorithm, subject to x-number of iterations attempts to draw a line the separates both binary classes perfectly where the Mis-classification Error (ME) of the linear discrimination model is 0 (no errors)
#'
#' @param Xinput      The features or x vectors; the perceptron model will be built for Xinput + 1 features
#' @param y_binary    The objective function, the predicted value (yes = 1, no = 0)
#' @param MAX_ITER    The maximum number of iterations for which the model attempts to fit perfectly; here we start at a random line and calculates all errors from j = 0, 1, ... , p
#' @param w           The weight vector from w_0(t=1), w_1(t=1), ... , w_p(t=1) reprenting the weight at each iterative line in MAX_ITER; w vector is initialized to zero for equal features of Xinput + 1
#'
#' @return            The computed final parameter (optimal weight(s)) as a vector of length p + the appended 1 (to p features)
perceptron_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 1000, w = NULL){
  if (is.null(w)){
    w= rep(0,ncol(Xinput)+1) 
  }
  Xinput = cbind(1,Xinput)
  for(iter in 1:MAX_ITER){ #step 4
    yhat_vec = as.numeric(Xinput %*% w>0)
    w_0 = w
    for ( i in 1: nrow(Xinput)){
      w= w + (y_binary[i]-yhat_vec[i])*Xinput[i,] #step 3
      
    }
   # print(class(w))
    #print(class(w_0))
    if(all(w==w_0)){
      break
    }
  }
  w
}

```

To understand what the algorithm is doing - linear "discrimination" between two response categories, we can draw a picture. First let's make up some very simple training data D.

```{r}
Xy_simple = data.frame(
 response = factor(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)), #nominal
 first_feature = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4),    #continuous
 second_feature = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3)    #continuous
)
```

We haven't spoken about visualization yet, but it is important we do some of it now. Thus, I will write this code for you and you will just run it. First we load the visualization library we're going to use:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
```

We are going to just get some plots and not talk about the code to generate them as we will have a whole unit on visualization using `ggplot2` in the future.

Let's first plot y by the two features so the coordinate plane will be the two features and we use different colors to represent the third dimension, y.

```{r}
simple_viz_obj = ggplot(Xy_simple, aes(x = first_feature, y = second_feature, color = response)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)
simple_viz_obj
```

This output shows two binary categories for p = 2 features; each point is the ordered pair of first and second feature and the color represents the output: 0 = No (red), 1 = Yes (blue)

Now, let us run the algorithm and see what happens:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_per = perceptron_learning_algorithm(
  cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature),
  as.numeric(Xy_simple$response == 1))
w_vec_simple_per
```

Explain this output. What do the numbers mean? What is the intercept of this line and the slope? You will have to do some algebra.

[-17 4 4] is our best fit line and has w_0 = -17, w_1 = 4, and w_2 = 4; the w_0 = -17 is the intercept/bias term


```{r}
simple_perceptron_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_per[1] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_per[2] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    color = "orange")
simple_viz_obj + simple_perceptron_line
```

Explain this picture. Why is this line of separation not "satisfying" to you?

Visually, the picture is not satisfying because using the slop-intercept form and connecting red{(2,1),(2,1)} and blue{(4,3), (4,3)} we get a slope of -1 for each y_binary category; our line should be at 3.5 on the x and y axis to generate the same slope; the line is slightly below 3.5 on either axis; at 3.5 on either axis the line will pass through (0,2) and (0,2.5) which yields a slope of -2/2.5 which is not equal to -1 

For extra credit, program the maximum-margin hyperplane perceptron that provides the best linear discrimination model for linearly separable data. Make sure you provide ROxygen documentation for this function.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```


## Support Vector Machine vs. Perceptron

We recreate the data from the previous lab and visualize it:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
Xy_simple = data.frame(
 response = factor(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)), #nominal
 first_feature = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4),    #continuous
 second_feature = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3)    #continuous
)
simple_viz_obj = ggplot(Xy_simple, aes(x = first_feature, y = second_feature, color = response)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5)
simple_viz_obj
```

Use the `e1071` package to fit an SVM model to the simple data. Use a formula to create the model, pass in the data frame, set kernel to be `linear` for the linear SVM and don't scale the covariates. Call the model object `svm_model`. Otherwise the remaining code won't work.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(e1071)
library(e1071)
svm_model = svm(
  formula = (y_i - 0.5)((w_vec%*%x_i_vec) - b) >= 0.5,
  data = Xy_simple$response,
  x = as.matrix(Xy_simple[, 2 : 3]),
  kernel = "linear", 
  scale = FALSE
)
as.matrix(Xy_simple[, 2 : 3])
```

and then use the following code to visualize the line in purple:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_svm = c(
  svm_model$rho, #the b term
  -t(svm_model$coefs) %*% cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature)[svm_model$index, ] # the other terms
)
simple_svm_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_svm[1] / w_vec_simple_svm[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_svm[2] / w_vec_simple_svm[3], 
    color = "purple")

simple_viz_obj + simple_svm_line
```

Source the `perceptron_learning_algorithm` function from lab 2. Then run the following to fit the perceptron and plot its line in orange with the SVM's line:

```{r}
w_vec_simple_per = perceptron_learning_algorithm(
  cbind(Xy_simple$first_feature, Xy_simple$second_feature),
  as.numeric(Xy_simple$response == 1)
)
simple_perceptron_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = -w_vec_simple_per[1] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    slope = -w_vec_simple_per[2] / w_vec_simple_per[3], 
    color = "orange")

simple_viz_obj + simple_perceptron_line + simple_svm_line
```

Is this SVM line a better fit than the perceptron? Yes

TO-DO

Now write pseuocode for your own implementation of the linear support vector machine algorithm using the Vapnik objective function we discussed.

Note there are differences between this spec and the perceptron learning algorithm spec in question #1. You should figure out a way to respect the `MAX_ITER` argument value. 


```{r}
#' Support Vector Machine 
#
#' This function implements the hinge-loss + maximum margin linear support vector machine algorithm of Vladimir Vapnik (1963).
#'
#' @param Xinput      The training data features as an n x p matrix.
#' @param y_binary    The training data responses as a vector of length n consisting of only 0's and 1's.
#' @param MAX_ITER    The maximum number of iterations the algorithm performs. Defaults to 5000.
#' @param lambda      A scalar hyperparameter trading off margin of the hyperplane versus average hinge loss.
#'                    The default value is 1.
#' @return            The computed final parameter (weight) as a vector of length p + 1
linear_svm_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 5000, lambda = 0.1){
  #Goal is to create an algorithm that locates maximum margin hyperplane in the SVM; this is the perceptron model
  #The top (y = 1) and bottom (y = 0) wedges must be linearly separable
  #There must be two critical observations (in y = 0 and y = 1) that are supported by the SVM
  #The slope of the line is transformed to Hesse Normal Form (vector notation)
  #The SVM defines teh following l_u and l_l (upper and lower wedges); these are the SVM
  #The wedge (l); middle of the support vectors
  #w_vector is any point on the line perpendicular to l_u and l_l
  #Let m > 0 be the perpendicular distance between l_u and l_l
  #Let delta > 0 be the distance between l_u and l_lon the x_2 axis
  #Objective is to maximize m and at the same time minimizing the w_vector as much as possible
  #variable c is the inverse of delta
  #The SVM is computed by optimizing the w_vector such that for every (y_i - 0.5) * (w_vec*x_vec - b) >= 0.5
  #We calculate the Sum of Hinge Error (SHE) as the summation of the maximum value (iterated from i = 1 to n) of 0 and 0.5 - (y_i - 0.5)*(w_vec*x_vec - b)
  #In order to maximize the margin, we will combine both considerations into the Vapnik objective function where we min of average distance errors (SHE) and the hyperparameter (tuning parameter) times the width of the wedge; there is a balancing act of minimizing the SHE while maximizing the width of the wedge
}
```


If you are enrolled in 342W the following is extra credit but if you're enrolled in a masters section, the following is required. Write the actual code. You may want to take a look at the `optimx` package. You can feel free to define another function (a "private" function) in this chunk if you wish. R has a way to create public and private functions, but I believe you need to create a package to do that (beyond the scope of this course).

```{r}
#' This function implements the hinge-loss + maximum margin linear support vector machine algorithm of Vladimir Vapnik (1963).

linear_svm_learning_algorithm = function(Xinput, y_binary, MAX_ITER = 5000, lambda = 0.1){
  #TO-DO
}
```

If you wrote code (the extra credit), run your function using the defaults and plot it in brown vis-a-vis the previous model's line:

```{r}
svm_model_weights = linear_svm_learning_algorithm(X_simple_feature_matrix, y_binary)
my_svm_line = geom_abline(
    intercept = svm_model_weights[1] / svm_model_weights[3],#NOTE: negative sign removed from intercept argument here
    slope = -svm_model_weights[2] / svm_model_weights[3], 
    color = "brown")
simple_viz_obj  + my_svm_line
```

Is this the same as what the `e1071` implementation returned? Why or why not?

## Multinomial Classification using KNN

Write a k = 1 nearest neighbor algorithm using the Euclidean distance function. The following comments are standard "Roxygen" format for documentation. Hopefully, we will get to packages at some point and we will go over this again. It is your job also to fill in this documentation.

```{r}
#' The Support Vector Machine (SVM) for K Nearest Neighbors 
#'
#' This function uses the binary classification of K nearest neighbors to determine the classification of k subject based on the distance between K and it's nearest neighbors
#'
#' @param Xinput      The x vector for each subject, from i = 1 to n; 
#' @param y_binary    The binary (0,1) output variable for the objective function
#' @param Xtest       This is our test dataset; we use this to determine the number of records;
#' @return            The 0 or 1 output which determines the category of the subject based on the distance between K and its nearest neighbors
nn_algorithm_predict = function(Xinput, y_binary, Xtest){
  yhat = array(NA, nrow(Xtest))
  for (istar in 1 : nrow(Xtest)) {
    yhat[istar] = y_binary[which.min(rowSums(t(t(Xinput) - Xtest[istar, ])^2))]
  }
  yhat
}

```

Write a few tests to ensure it actually works:
There will be no error for K = 1 because d = 0, the distance from K-itself
```{r}
pacman::p_load(class)
yhat = knn(Xinput, Xinput, y_binary, k = 1)
yhat = knn(Xinput, Xinput, y_binary, k = 2)
yhat = knn(Xinput, Xinput, y_binary, k = 3) #etc
```

We now add an argument `d` representing any legal distance function to the `nn_algorithm_predict` function. Update the implementation so it performs NN using that distance function. Set the default function to be the Euclidean distance in the original function. Also, alter the documentation in the appropriate places.

```{r}
#TO-DO
```

For extra credit (unless you're a masters student), add an argument `k` to the `nn_algorithm_predict` function and update the implementation so it performs KNN. In the case of a tie, choose yhat randomly. Set the default `k` to be the square root of the size of D which is an empirical rule-of-thumb popularized by the "Pattern Classification" book by Duda, Hart and Stork (2007). Also, alter the documentation in the appropriate places.

```{r}
#TO-DO for the 650 students but extra credit for undergrads
```
